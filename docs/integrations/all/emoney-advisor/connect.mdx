# Overview

To authenticate with eMoney Advisor, you need:
1. **API Base URL** - The eMoney API base URL for your environment.
2. **Token Audience** - The JWT audience claim expected by eMoney.
3. **API Client ID** - The client identifier provided by eMoney onboarding.
4. **Private Key** - An RSA private key in PEM format used to sign JWTs.

eMoney onboarding also requires submitting an X.509 public certificate signed by a trusted CA.

### Prerequisites:

- You must have eMoney API access approved by eMoney.

### Instructions:

#### Step 1: Get your eMoney API details

1. Submit the eMoney contact form and request API access.
2. Complete onboarding with the eMoney team.
3. Collect the values they provide for:
   - API Base URL

#### Step 2: Generate your RSA private key

Generate a 2048-bit RSA private key:

```bash
openssl genrsa -out emoney_auth.key 2048
```

Store this key securely and do not share it.

#### Step 3: Generate and submit your X.509 certificate

eMoney requires a public certificate signed by an external trusted CA.

1. Generate a CSR from your private key:

```bash
openssl req -new -key emoney_auth.key -out emoney_auth.csr
```

2. Submit the CSR through the process provided by eMoney.
3. Keep the signed certificate for your records and onboarding confirmations.

#### Step 4: Enter credentials in the Connect UI

Once you have your API details and private key:

1. Open the eMoney Advisor connection form in Nango.
